Pac-Man Exercise

In this project, you will create a pacman on demand. This will be done by hitting the "Add PacMan" button. Once you add as many pacmen as you desire, you will then select "Start Game". The "Start Game" button then moves all the pacmen on the screen in a random pattern around the window screen.

Here is how you play the game:
1. Click "Add PacMan" to add a PacMan to the screen.
2. Click "Start Game" to move the PacMen around the screen.
3. Watch the PacMen move.


Future Improvements:
1. Everytime the "Add PacMan" button is clicked, the PacMan will change colors randomly.
2. When you click the "Start Game" have the PacMen move in a synchronous movement to create an pattern.
